# Hotel Data Analysis SQL Project

## Description

Welcome to the Hotel Data Analysis SQL Project! This project is designed to analyze a comprehensive dataset of hotel bookings to extract meaningful insights and trends. Using SQL, we perform various analyses to understand booking patterns, customer demographics, and other key performance indicators in the hospitality industry.

### Project Goals

- **Identify Booking Trends**: Analyze booking data to uncover trends over time, including seasonal variations and peak periods.
- **Customer Insights**: Examine customer demographics to better understand the preferences and behaviors of different customer segments.
- **Hotel Performance Metrics**: Assess various metrics such as occupancy rates, average length of stay, and booking conversion rates.

### Key Features

- **SQL Scripts**: A collection of SQL scripts to perform data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
- **Data Exploration**: Explore different aspects of the data, including booking dates, customer details, and hotel attributes.
- **Visualization**: Although primarily SQL-based, you can integrate the analysis with visualization tools to better represent the findings.

### Dataset

The dataset includes the following tables:
- **Bookings**: Details about individual bookings.
- **Guests**: Demographic information of guests.
- **Hotels**: Information about hotels, including their location and rating.
- **Rooms**: Details on room types and their availability.
